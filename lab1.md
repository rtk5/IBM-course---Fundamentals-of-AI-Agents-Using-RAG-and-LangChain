Looking at your Colab notebook code, here's a breakdown of the major functions and code segments:

## **Setup and Imports**
- Installs required libraries (transformers, datasets, torch, faiss-cpu, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Imports necessary modules for DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval), visualization, and text generation

## **Visualization Function**
```python
def tsne_plot(data)
```
- Uses t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional embeddings to 3D for visualization
- Creates a 3D scatter plot where each point represents a text embedding
- Helps visualize how similar texts cluster together in embedding space

## **Data Loading**
- Downloads a company policies text file from a URL using wget
- `read_and_split_text()` function splits the text into individual paragraphs
- Filters out empty paragraphs and prepares the text for processing

## **Context Encoding (DPR)**
- Uses Facebook's DPR context encoder to convert text paragraphs into dense vector embeddings
- `encode_contexts()` function processes a list of texts and returns their embeddings
- Each paragraph gets converted to a 768-dimensional vector representation

## **FAISS Index Creation**
- Creates a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index for efficient similarity search
- Stores all paragraph embeddings in the index for fast retrieval
- Uses L2 distance for measuring similarity between embeddings

## **Question Encoding and Retrieval**
```python
def search_relevant_contexts()
```
- Uses DPR question encoder to convert questions into embeddings
- Searches the FAISS index to find the most relevant paragraphs
- Returns top-k most similar contexts based on embedding similarity

## **Text Generation (GPT-2)**
Two main generation functions:

```python
def generate_answer_without_context()
```
- Generates answers using only GPT-2 without any retrieved context
- Directly processes the question and generates a response

```python
def generate_answer()
```
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach
- Combines the question with retrieved relevant contexts
- Feeds this combined input to GPT-2 for more informed answer generation

## **Complete RAG Pipeline Example**
The final section demonstrates the full pipeline:
1. Takes a question ("what is mobile policy?")
2. Retrieves top 5 relevant contexts using DPR + FAISS
3. Generates an answer using GPT-2 with the retrieved contexts
4. Compares results with and without context

## **Overall Purpose**
This code implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that:
- Encodes company policy documents into searchable embeddings
- Retrieves relevant information based on user questions
- Generates contextually-aware answers by combining retrieval with language generation

The system allows you to ask questions about company policies and get answers grounded in the actual policy documents rather than just the model's training data.
